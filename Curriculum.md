 ## Course Topics - Human Science Lab 1

### Classes 1-2

#### Introduction

General intorduction, followed by introduction to the various problems connected with generation, visualisation and interpretation in Big Data analysis.

### Classes 3-4

#### Bag of Words exercise

This exercise involves creating a Bag of words from monographs using computational tools, followed by a brief analysis.                        
Students will be given two texts, on which the Bag of Words will be performed. Analysis of the BoW results will follow. Students will be encouraged to understand the similarities and the differences in the texts (revealed both by and without BoW exercise). They will be introduced to the importance of historical/sociological/political context. Students will also be ancouraged to read the texts, to be able to benefit from the exercise.

### Classes 5-7

#### Identification and interpretation of correlation in social data

Computational tools will be used to draw correlations between the sets of social data (education and income/education and infant mortality, presence of natural resources and income etc). Analysis of the results will follow. Students will be encouraged to ask themselves why certain social data is closely correlated and more important, why not. This will require an understanding and appreciation of historical/sociological/political context and theory.

### Classes 8-10

#### Working with Tweets

This exercise involves using computational tools to crawl and analyse tweets. This will be followed by an analysis of results, from a social science perspective, wherein students will identify the political/sociological context of the tweets. Students will particularly be encouraged to see the potential as well as the limitations of using computational tools.

### Classes 11-13

#### Working with Newspaper Articles

This exercise invloves using computational tools to scrape and analyse newspaper articles. This will be followed by an analysis of the results, from a social science perspective, wherein students will identify the political/sociological context of the articles. Students will particularly be encouraged to see the potential as well as the limitations of using computational tools.

### Classes 14-16

#### Working with Political Data

This exercise involves scraping of election-related data from various sites (Association for Democratic reforms, Election Commission of India, Lokniti, etc). This will be followed by organization of this data in a manner that facilitates further analysis. Students will also learn to present data in useful ways. Students will be encouraged to analyse the data from a sociological/political lens.
